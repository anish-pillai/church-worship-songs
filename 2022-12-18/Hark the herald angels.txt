Hark! the herald angels sing,
"Glory to the newborn King:
peace on earth, and mercy mild,
God and sinners reconciled!"
[===]
Joyful, all ye nations, rise,
join the triumph of the skies;
with th'angelic hosts proclaim,
"Christ is born in Bethlehem!"
[===]
Hark! the herald angels sing,
"Glory to the newborn King"
[===]
Christ, by highest heaven adored,
Christ, the everlasting Lord,
late in time behold him come,
offspring of the Virgin's womb:
[===]
veiled in flesh the Godhead see;
hail th'incarnate Deity,
[===]
pleased with us in flesh to dwell,
Jesus, our Immanuel. [Refrain]
[===]
Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace!
Hail the Son of Righteousness!
Light and life to all he brings,
risen with healing in his wings.
[===]
Mild he lays his glory by,
born that we no more may die,
born to raise us from the earth,
born to give us second birth.
