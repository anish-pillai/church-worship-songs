As the deer pants for the water
So my soul longs after You
You alone are my heart’s desire
And I long to worship You
[===]
You alone are my strength, my shield
To You alone may my spirit yield
You alone are my heart’s desire
And I long to worship You
[===]
As the deer pants for the water
So my soul longs after You
You alone are my heart’s desire
And I long to worship You
[===]
You alone are my strength, my shield
To You alone may my spirit yield
You alone are my heart’s desire
And I long to worship You
[===]
You’re my friend
And You are my brother
Even though You are a King
I love You more than any other
So much more than anything
[===]
You alone are my strength, my shield
To You alone may my spirit yield
You alone are my heart’s desire
And I long to worship You
