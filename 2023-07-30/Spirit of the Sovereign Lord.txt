Let the weight of Your glory cover us
Let the life of Your river flow
Let the truth of Your kingdom reign in us
Let the weight of Your glory

Let the weight of Your glory fall

We only seek Your face
We want to know You
We want to see You
Reveal Your glory in this place

 Let the weight of Your glory
Let the weight of Your glory fall
