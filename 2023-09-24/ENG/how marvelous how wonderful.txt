I stand amazed in the presence
Of Jesus the Nazarene
And wonder how He could love me
A sinner, condemned, unclean
[===]
Singing, how marvelous! how wonderful!
And my song shall ever be
How marvelous and how wonderful!
Is my Savior's love for me!
[===]
I sing that first first again as "I stand amazed"
