Light of the world you step down into darkness  
Opened my eyes let me see 
Beauty that makes this heart adore You 
Hope of a life spent with You

Here I am to say that your my God

Your altogether lovely 
Altogether worthy  
Altogether wonderful to me

Oh so highly exalted 
Glorious in Heaven above 
Humbly You came to the earth you created 
All for loves sake became poor

So here I am to worship  
Here I am to bow down  
Here I am to say that your my God

Your altogether lovely 
Altogether worthy  
Altogether wonderful to me
