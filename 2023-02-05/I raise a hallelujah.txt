I raise a hallelujah in the presence of my enemies
I raise a hallelujah louder than the unbelief

I raise a hallelujah, my weapon is a melody
I raise a hallelujah, Heaven comes to fight for me

I'm gonna sing in the middle of the storm
Louder and louder, you're gonna hear my praises roar

Up from the ashes, hope will arise
Death is defeated, the King is alive

I raise a hallelujah with everything inside of me
I raise a hallelujah, I will watch the darkness flee

I raise a hallelujah in the middle of the mystery
I raise a hallelujah, fear, you lost your hold on me

I'm gonna sing in the middle of the storm
Louder and louder, you're gonna hear my praises roar

Up from the ashes, hope will arise
Death is defeated, the King is alive
