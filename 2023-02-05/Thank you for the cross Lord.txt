Thank You For The Cross, Lord,
Thank You For The Price You Paid
Bearing All My Sin And Shame,
In Love You Came
And Gave Amazing Grace.

Thank You For This Love, Lord,
Thank You For The Nail-Pierced Hands
Washed Me In Your Cleansing Flow,
Now All I Know
Your Forgiveness And Embrace.

Worthy Is The Lamb
Seated On The Throne,
Crown You Now With Many Crowns
[===]
You Reign Victorious,
High And Lifted Up,
Jesus, Son Of God,
The Darling Of Heaven Crucified.

Worthy Is The Lamb
