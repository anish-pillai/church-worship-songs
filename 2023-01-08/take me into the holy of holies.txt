Take me past the outer courts
Into the Holy Place
Past the brazen Alter
Lord, I want to see Your face
[===]
Pass me by the crowds of people
The priests who sing Your praise
I hunger and thirst for Your righteousness
But it's only found in one place

Take me into the Holy of Holies
Take me in by the blood of the Lamb
Take me into the Holy of Holies
Take the coal, touch my lips, here I am
