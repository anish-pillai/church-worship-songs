Higher than the mountains
That I face
Stronger than the power
Of the grave
[===]
Constant through the trial
And the change
One thing remains
This one thing remains
[===]
Your love never fails
And never gives up
It never runs out on me
Your love never fails
And never gives up
[===]
It never runs out on me
Your love never fails
And never gives up
It never runs out on me
[===]
Because on and on and on
And on it goes
Before it overwhelms
And satisfies my soul
And I never ever have to be afraid
One thing remains
[===]
Your love never fails
And never gives up
It never runs out on me
[===]
Your love never fails
And never gives up
It never runs out on me
Your love
[===]
In death in life
I'm confident and covered by the power
Of your great love
[===]
My debt is paid there's nothing
That can separate
My heart from Your great love
[===]
Your love never fails
And never gives up
It never runs out on me
[===]
Your love never fails
And never gives up
It never runs out on me
[===]
On and on
Your love goes on and on
[===]
Because on and on and on
And on it goes
Before it overwhelms
And satisfies my soul
And I never ever have to be afraid
[===]
One thing remains
This one thing remains
[===]
Your love never fails
And never gives up
It never runs out on me
[===]
Your love never fails
And never gives up
It never runs out on me
