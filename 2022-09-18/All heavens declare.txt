All heaven declares the glory of the risen Lord
Who can compare with the beauty of the Lord?
[===]
Forever He will be the Lamb upon the throne
I gladly bow my knee and worship Him alone
[===]
I will proclaim the glory of the risen Lord
Who once was slain to reconcile man to God
Forever You will be the Lamb upon the throne
I gladly bow my knee and worship You alone
[===]
Forever You will be (Forever You will be)
The Lamb upon the throne
I gladly bow my knee
And worship You alone
