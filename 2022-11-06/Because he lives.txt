God sent His son, they called Him Jesus
He came to love, heal and forgive
He lived and died to buy my pardon
An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives
[===]
Because He lives, I can face tomorrow
Because He lives, all fear is gone
Because I know He holds the future
And life is worth the living, just because He lives
[===]
How sweet to hold a newborn baby
And feel the pride and joy He gives
But greater still the calm assurance
This child can face uncertain days, because He lives
[===]
Because He lives, I can face tomorrow
Because He lives, all fear is gone
Because I know He holds the future
And life is worth the living, just because He lives
[===]
Because He lives, I can face tomorrow
Because He lives, all fear is gone
Because I know He holds the future
And life is worth the living, just because He lives
[===]
Ooh, yeah yeah yeah
Because He lives, because He lives
Because He lives, because He lives
Because He lives, because He lives
[===]
Because He lives, because He lives
Because He lives, because He lives
Because He lives, because He lives

Oh river of God, flow down on me.
Oh river of God, flow out from me.
Oh river of God, so rich and free.
Oh river of God, I come to Thee.
