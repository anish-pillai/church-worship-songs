You unravel me with a melody
You surround me with a song
Of deliverance from my enemies
Till all my fears are gone
[===]
I’m no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I’m no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
[===]
From my mothers womb
You have chosen me
Love has called my name
I’ve been born again, into your family
Your blood flows through my veins
[===]
I’m no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I’m no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
[===]
You split the sea
So I could walk right throug
My fears were drowned in perfect love
You rescued me
And I will stand an sing
I am a child of God
[===]
I am the child of God (yes I am)
I am a Child of God
I am a Child of God (yes I am)
I am a Child of God
I am a Child of God
I am a Child of God
[===]
I’m no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I’m no longer slave to fear
I am a child of God
