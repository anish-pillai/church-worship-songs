All these pieces
Broken and scattered
In mercy gathered
Mended and whole
[===]
Empty handed
But not forsaken
I've been set free
I've been set free
[===]
Amazing grace
How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
[===]
I once was lost
But now I am found
Was blind but now I see
[===]
Oh I can see You now
Oh I can see the love in Your eyes
Laying Yourself down
Raising up the broken to life
[===]
You take our failure
You take our weakness
You set Your treasure
In jars of clay
[===]
So take this heart Lord
I'll be Your vessel
The world to see Your life in me
[===]
Take my heart
Take my soul
Take my mind and I will
[===]
Give my thoughts
Give my all
Give my life to follow You
[===]
Take my hands
Take my breath
Take my dreams and I will
[===]
Lift my eyes
Lift my faith
Lift my voice and worship You
