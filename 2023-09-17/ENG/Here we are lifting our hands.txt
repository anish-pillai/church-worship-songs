Here we are lifting our hands to You
Here we are giving You thanks for all You do
As we praise and worship Your holy name
You are here, dwelling within our praise
[===]
For every answer prayer
For always being there
For love that hears us when we call
For arms that lift us when we fall
[===]
Oh, You have always been right beside us
Leading us all along the way
And we made it through
(We made it through)
Because of You
[===]
Here we are lifting our hands to You
Here we are giving You thanks for all You do
As we praise and worship Your holy name
You are here, dwelling within our praise
[===]
For days we cannot see
(For days we cannot see)
For all that yet to be
(So much is yet to be)
[===]
The trials we may have to face
When we'll be leaning on Your grace
It will be Your strength that saves us
Your love that makes us strong
[===]
And through it all
(Through it all)
We'll sing this song
[===]
Here we are lifting our hands to You
Here we are giving You thanks for all You do
As we praise and worship Your holy name
You are here, dwelling within our praise
[===]
You are here, dwelling within our praise
You are here, dwelling within our praise
