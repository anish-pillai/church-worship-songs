Lord I Come To You
Let My Heart Be Changed, Renewed
Flowing From The Grace
That I’ve Found In You.

The Weakness I See In Me
Will Be Stripped Away
By The Power Of Your Love.

And As I Wait
I’ll Rise Up Like The Eagle
And I Will Soar With You
Your Spirit Leads Me On
In The Power Of Your Love.

The Knowledge Of Your Love
As You Live In Me.

As Your Will Unfolds In My Life
In Living Every Day
