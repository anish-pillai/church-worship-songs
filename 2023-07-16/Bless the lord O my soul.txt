Bless the Lord oh my soul
Oh my soul
Worship His Holy name
[===]
Sing like never before
Oh my soul
I'll worship Your Holy name
[===]
The sun comes up
It's a new day dawning
It's time to sing Your song again
[===]
Whatever may pass
And whatever lies before me
[===]
Let me be singing
When the evening comes
[===]
Bless the Lord oh my soul
Oh my soul
Worship His Holy name
[===]
Sing like never before
Oh my soul
I'll worship Your Holy name
[===]
You're rich in love
And You're slow to anger
[===]
Your name is great
And Your heart is kind
[===]
For all Your goodness
I will keep on singing
[===]
Ten thousand reasons
For my heart to find
[===]
And on that day when my strength is failing
The end draws near and my time has come
Still, my soul will sing Your praise unending
Ten thousand years and then forevermore
Forevermore
[===]
Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul
Worship His holy name
Sing like never before, O my soul
I'll worship Your holy name
[===]
Bless the Lord, O my soul, O my soul
Worship His holy name
Sing like never before, O my soul
I'll worship Your holy name
Yes, I will worship Your holy name
Lord, I'll worship Your holy name
[===]
Sing like never before, O my soul
I'll worship Your holy name
Jesus, I will worship Your holy name
Worship Your holy name
