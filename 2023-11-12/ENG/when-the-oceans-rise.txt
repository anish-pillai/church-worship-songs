Hide me now
Under Your wings
Cover me
Within Your mighty hand
[===]
When the oceans rise and thunders roar
I will soar with You above the storm
[===]
Father you are King over the flood
I will be still, know You are God
[===]
Find rest my soul
In Christ alone
Know His power
In quietness and trust
[===]
Find rest my soul
In Christ alone
Know His power
In quietness and trust
