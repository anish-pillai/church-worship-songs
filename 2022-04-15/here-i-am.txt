Here I am
Down on my knees again
Surrendering all
Surrendering all
[===]
And find me here
Lord as You draw me near
I'm desperate for You
I'm desperate for You
[===]
I surrender
Drench my soul
As mercy and grace unfold
I hunger and thirst
I hunger and thirst
[===]
With arms stretched wide
I know You hear my cry
Speak to me now
Speak to me now
[===]
I surrender
I surrender
I wanna know You more
I wanna know You more
[===]
I surrender
I surrender
I wanna know You more
I wanna know You more
[===]
Like a rushing wind
Jesus breathe within
Lord have Your way
Lord have Your way in me
[===]
Like a mighty storm
Stir within my soul
Lord have Your way
Lord have Your way in me
Like a rushing wind
[===]
Jesus breathe within
Lord have Your way
Lord have Your way in me
Like a mighty storm
[===]
Stir within my soul
Lord have Your way
Lord have Your way in me
Like a rushing wind
[===]
Jesus breathe within
Lord have Your way
Lord have Your way in me (like a mighty storm)
Like a mighty storm
[===]
Stir within my soul
Lord have Your way
Lord have Your way in me
Lord have Your way
Lord have Your way in me
[===]
I surrender
I surrender
I wanna know You more
I wanna know You more
[===]
I surrender
I surrender
I wanna know You more
I wanna know You more
