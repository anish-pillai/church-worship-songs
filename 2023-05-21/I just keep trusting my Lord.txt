I Just Keep Trusting My Lord
As I Walk Along,
I Just Keep Trusting My Lord
As He Gives Me A Song.

Those Storm Clouds Darken The Sky
Over The Heavenly Trail
I Just Keep Trusting My Lord
He Will Never Fail.

Heâ€™s A Faithful Friend [2] 
Such A Faithful Friend [2] 
I Can Count On Him [2] 
To The Very End. [2]

I Just Keep Trusting My Lord
As I Walk Along,
I Just Keep Trusting My Lord
And He Gives Me A Song.
