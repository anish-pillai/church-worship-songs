Let Everything That, Everything That
Everything That Has Breath Praise The Lord
Let Everything That, Everything That
Everything That Has Breath Praise The Lord
[===]
Praise You In The Morning, Praise You In The Evening
Praise You When I’m Young And When I’m Old
Praise You When I’m Laughing, Praise You With I’m Grieving
Praise You Every Season Of The Soul
[===]
If We Could See How Much You’re Worth
Your Power, Your Might, Your Endless Love
Then Surely We Would Never Cease To Praise
[===]
Let Everything That, Everything That
Everything That Has Breath Praise The Lord
Let Everything That, Everything That
Everything That Has Breath Praise The Lord
[===]
Praise You In The Heavens, Joining With The Angels
Praising You Forever And A Day
Praise You On The Earth Now, Joining With Creation
Calling All The Nations To Your Praise
[===]
If We Could See How Much You’re Worth
Your Power, Your Might, Your Endless Love
Then Surely We Would Never Cease To Praise
[===]
Let Everything That, Everything That
Everything That Has Breath Praise The Lord
Let Everything That, Everything That
Everything That Has Breath Praise The Lord [2]
