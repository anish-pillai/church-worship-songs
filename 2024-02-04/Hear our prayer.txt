Hear our prayer
We are Your children
And we've gathered here today
We've gathered here to pray
[===]
Hear our cry
O Lord, we need Your mercy
And we need Your grace today (yes we do)
Hear us as we pray
[===]
Our Father, who art in Heaven
Hallowed be Thy name
Our Father, hear us from Heaven
Forgive our sins we pray
[===]
Hear our song
As it rises to Heaven
May Your glory fill the earth
As the waters cover the sea
[===]
See our hearts
And remove anything
That is standing in the way
Of coming to You today
[===]
Our Father, who art in Heaven
Hallowed be Thy name
Our Father, hear us from Heaven
Forgive our sins we pray
[===]
And though we are few
We're surrounded by many
Who have crossed that river before
And this is the song we'll be singing forever
[===]
Holy is the Lord
Holy is the Lord
Holy is the Lord
Holy is the Lord
[===]
Our Father, who art in Heaven
Hallowed be Thy name
Our Father, hear us from Heaven
Forgive our sins we pray
[===]
Forgive our sins we pray
Forgive our sins we pray
