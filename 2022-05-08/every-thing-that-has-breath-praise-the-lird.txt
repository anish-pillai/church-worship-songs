Let everything that
Everything that
Everything that
Has breath praise the Lord

Let everything that
Everything that
Everything that
Has breath praise the Lord

Praise You in the morning
Praise You in the evening
Praise You when I'm young
And when I'm old
[===]
Praise You when I'm laughing
Praise You when I'm grieving
Praise You every
Season of the soul
[===]
If we could see
How much You're worth
Your power
Your might
Your endless love
Then surely we would
Never cease to praise
