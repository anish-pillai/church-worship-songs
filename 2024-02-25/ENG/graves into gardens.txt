I searched the world
But it couldn't fill me
Man's empty praise and treasures that fade are never enough
Then You came along
[===]
And put me back together
And every desire is now satisfied
Here in Your love (Hey)
[===]
Oh, there's nothing better than You
There's nothing better than You
Lord, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You
[===]
Oh, yes, I know it's true
Come on, stand up
[===]
I'm not afraid
To show You my weakness
My failures and flaws
Lord, You've seen them all
[===]
And You still call me friend
'Cause the God of the mountain
Is the God of the valley
There's not a place Your mercy and grace
Won't find me again
[===]
Oh, there's nothing better than You
There's nothing (Oh) better than You
Lord, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You (I know it's true)
[===]
Oh, there's nothing better than You (Somebody testify)
There's nothing better than you (Oh, there's nothing, nothing, no)
Lord, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You
[===]
Faith has made a way for you all so you can sing this
Come on, tear the roof off
[===]
You turn mourning to dancing
You give beauty for ashes
You turn shame into glory
You're the only one who can (Come on)
[===]
You turn mourning to dancing
You give beauty for ashes
You turn shame into glory (Tell 'em now)
You're the only one who can (Let's turn the graves)
[===]
You turn graves into gardens
You turn bones into armies
You turn seas into highways
You're the only one who can (He's the only Lord)
You're the only one who can
[===]
Oh, there's nothing (Come on, choir) better than You
There's nothing better than You
Lord, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You (Search and not found)
[===]
Oh, there's nothing better than You
There's nothing better than you (Oh, there's nothing)
Lord, there's nothing
Nothing is better than You
[===]
Oh, come on, let's turn our graves into a garden, say:
[===]
You turn graves into gardens
You turn bones into armies
You turn seas into highways
You're the only one who can (Turn to graves)
[===]
You turn graves into gardens (Turn your bones into an army)
You turn bones into armies (He's makin' waves through the seas)
[===]
You turn seas into highways
You're the only one who can
You're the only one who can (Praise to the Lord)
You're the only one who can
You're the only one who can
[===]
Somebody give Him praise in this house
Woo
I don't think we're finished yet, come on
I think He's turning some things over tonight
You turn my mourning into dancing, come on:
[===]
You turn mourning to dancing (Yeah)
You give beauty for ashes (Shame into glory)
You turn shame into glory (Say it, the only name)
You're the only one who can (Oh, He's turnin' my grave)
[===]
You turn graves into gardens
You turn bones into armies (He's makin' waves through the seas)
You turn seas into highways (You're the only)
You're the only one who can (Come on, one more time, you turn my grave into a garden)
[===]
You turn graves into gardens (You're resurrectin' bones)
You turn bones into armies (You're makin' waves through my sea)
[===]
You turn seas into highways (Shout it out, You're the only)
You're the only one who can (You're the only)
[===]
You're the only one who can (You're the only)
You're the only one who can
[===]
Jesus, You're the only one
Come on, give Him one more shout of praise
