You are my strength when I am weak
You are the treasure that I seek
You are my all in all
[===]
Seeking You as a precious jewel
Lord to give up I'd be a fool
You are my all in all
[===]
Jesus Lamb of God
Worthy is your name
Jesus Lamb of God
Worthy is your name
[===]
Taking my sin my cross my shame
Rising again I bless your name
You are my all in all
[===]
When I fall down you pick me up
When I am dry You fill my cup
You are my all in all
