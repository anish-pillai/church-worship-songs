Over The Mountains And The Sea
Your River Runs With Love For Me
And I Will Open Up My Heart
And Let The Healer Set Me Free
[===]
I’m Happy To Be In The Truth
And I Will Daily Lift My Hands
For I Will Always Sing
Of When Your Love Came Down
[===]
I Could Sing Of Your Love Forever
I Could Sing Of Your Love Forever
I Could Sing Of Your Love Forever
I Could Sing Of Your Love Forever
[===]
Oh I Feel Like Dancing
It’s Foolishness I Know
But When The World
Has Seen The Light
They Will Dance With Joy
Like We’re Dancing Now
[===]
I Could Sing Of Your Love Forever
I Could Sing Of Your Love Forever
I Could Sing Of Your Love Forever
I Could Sing Of Your Love Forever
