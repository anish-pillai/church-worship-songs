Father God, I Wonder
How I Managed To Exist
Without The Knowledge Of Your Parenthood
And Your Loving, Care
[===]
But Now I Am Your Son,
I Am Adopted In Your Family
And I Can Never Be Alone
‘Cause Father God,
You’re There Beside Me
[===]
I Will Sing Your Praises
I Will Sing Your Praises
I Will Sing Your Praises
Forever More

I Will Sing Your Praises
I Will Sing Your Praises
I Will Sing Your Praises
Forever More
