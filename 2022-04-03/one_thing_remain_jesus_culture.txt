Higher than the mountains that I face
Stronger than the power of the grave
Constant in the trial and the change
This one thing remains (2x)
[===]
Your love never fails, never gives up
It never runs out on me (x3)
Your love
[===]
And on and on and on and on it goes
It overwhelms and satisfies my soul
And I'll never, ever, have to be afraid
Cause this one thing remains (2x)
[===]
Your love never fails, never gives up
Never runs out on me (3x)
