Lord, i come before Your throne of grace
I find rest in Your presence,
And fullness of Joy
In worship and wonder
I behold Your face
Singing what a faithful God have I
[===]
What a faithful God have I
What a faithful God
What a faithful God have I
Faithful in every way
[===]
Lord of mercy, You have heard my cry
Through the storm Youre the beacon
My song in the night
In the shelter of Your wings
Hear my hearts reply
Singing what a faithful God have I
[===]
What a faithful God have I
What a faithful God
What a faithful God have I
Faithful in every way
[===]
Lord all sovereign
Granting peace from heaven
Let me comfort those who suffer
With the comfort You have given
I will tell of Your great love
For as long as i live
Singing what a faithful God have I
