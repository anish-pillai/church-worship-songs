I'm trading my sorrows
I'm trading my shame
I'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord
[===]
I'm trading my sickness
I'm trading my pain
I'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord
[===]
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord
Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes yes Lord, Amen
[===]
I am pressed but not crushed,
Persecuted not abandoned
Struck down but not destroyed
I am blessed beyond the curse
[===]
For His promise will endure
That His joy is gonna be my strength
Though the sorrow may last for the night
His joy comes in the morning              || Yes Lord ||

I'm trading my sorrows
I'm trading my shame
I'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord
[===]
I'm trading my sickness
I'm trading my pain
I'm laying them down for the joy of the Lord     || Yes Lord ||
