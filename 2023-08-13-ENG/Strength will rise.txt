Strength will rise as we wait upon the Lord,
we will wait upon the Lord,
we will wait upon the Lord. (X2)
[===]
Our God, you reign forever.
Our hope, our Strong Deliverer.
[===]
You are the everlasting God,
the everlasting God.
You do not faint,
you won’t grow weary.
[===]
You’re the defender of the weak,
you comfort those in need.
You lift us up on wings like eagles.
