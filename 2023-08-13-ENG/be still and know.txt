Hide me now
Under Your wings
Cover me
Within Your mighty hand
[===]
When the oceans rise
And thunders roar
I Will soar with You
Above the storm
[===]
Father You are King
Over the flood
And I will be still
And know You are God
[===]
Find rest my soul
In Christ alone
Know His power
In quietness and trust
[===]
When the oceans rise
And thunders roar
I Will soar with You
Above the storm
[===]
Father You are King
Over the flood
And I will be still
And know You are God
[===]
When the oceans rise
And thunders roar
I Will soar with You
Above the storm
[===]
Father You are King
Over the flood
And I will be still
And know You are God
[===]
I will be still
And know You are God
[===]
I will be still
And know You are God
[===]
Be still and know
That I am God
Be still and know
That I am God
Be still and know
That I am God
[===]
I am the God
That healeth thee
I am the God
That healeth thee
I am the God
That healeth thee

God said to us in Isaiah 43
He's called us by name
when we go through the deep water and great trouble
[===]
He will be with us
when we go through rivers of difficulty
We will not drawn
When we walk through the fire of oppression
[===]
We will not not be burned-up
The flame will not consume us
For He's our Lord, our God,
The only one of Israel
Our Saviour

Over the flood
And I will be still
And know You are God
[===]
When the oceans rise
And thunders roar
I Will soar with You
Above the storm
[===]
Father You are King
Over the flood
And I will be still
And know You are God
I will be still
And know You are God
[===]
I will be still
And know You are God
