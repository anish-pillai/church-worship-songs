Go tell it on the mountain,
over the hills, and ev'rywhere;
go, tell it on the mountain
that Jesus Christ is born.
[===]
While shepherds kept their watching
o’er silent flocks by night,
behold, throughout the heavens
there shone a holy light.
[===]
The shepherds feared and trembled
when lo, above the earth
rang out the angel chorus
that hailed our Savior’s birth.
[===]
Down in a lowly manger
the humble Christ was born,
and God sent us salvation
that blessed Christmas morn.
