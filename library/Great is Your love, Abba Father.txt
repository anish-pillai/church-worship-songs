Great is Your love, Abba Father

Jesus You’re more than I deserve
Your love, rescued me

Humbly You came into this world
Lay down Your life and chose to serve

Just as I am without one plea
Your love rescued me

You are my Saviour, My great Redeemer
And by Your blood now I can be free

You are my Saviour, My loving Father
For all eternity, Worship Your Majesty
