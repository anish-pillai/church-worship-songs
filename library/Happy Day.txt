The greatest day in history, death is beaten
You have rescued me
Sing it out, Jesus is alive
[===]
The empty cross, the empty grave
Life eternal, You have won the day
Shout it all, Jesus is alive
He's alive
[===]
Oh happy day, happy day
You washed my sin away
Oh happy day, happy day
I'll never be the same
Forever I am changed
[===]
When I stand, in that place
Free at last, meeting face to face
I am Yours, Jesus You are mine
Endless joy and perfect peace
Earthly pain finally will cease
Celebrate Jesus is alive
He's alive
[===]
Oh what a glorious day
What a glorious way
That You have saved me
Oh what a glorious day
What a glorious name
Jesus!
