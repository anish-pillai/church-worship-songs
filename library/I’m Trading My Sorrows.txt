I’m Trading My Sorrows
I’m Trading My Shame
I’m Laying Them Down For The Joy Of The Lord
[===]
I’m Trading My Sickness
I’m Trading My Pain
I’m Laying Them Down For The Joy Of The Lord
And We’re Singing
[===]
Yes Lord, Yes Lord, Yes Yes Lord
Yes Lord, Yes Lord, Yes Yes Lord
Yes Lord, Yes Lord, Yes Yes Lord, Amen
[===]
I Am Pressed But Not Crushed,
Persecuted Not Abandoned
Struck Down But Not Destroyed
I Am Blessed Beyond The Curse
[===]
For His Promise Will Endure
That His Joy Is Gonna Be My Strength
Though The Sorrow May Last For The Night
His Joy Comes In The Morning
[===]
I’m Trading My Sorrows
I’m Trading My Shame
I’m Laying Them Down For The Joy Of The Lord

I’m Trading My Sickness
I’m Trading My Pain
I’m Laying Them Down For The Joy Of The Lord
And We’re Singing
[===]
Yes Lord, Yes Lord, Yes Yes Lord
Yes Lord, Yes Lord, Yes Yes Lord
Yes Lord, Yes Lord, Yes Yes Lord, Amen
[===]
And We’re Singing
Yes Lord, Yes Lord, Yes Yes Lord
Yes Lord, Yes Lord, Yes Yes Lord
Yes Lord, Yes Lord, Yes Yes Lord, Amen
[===]
Yes Lord, Amen
Yes Lord, Amen!
