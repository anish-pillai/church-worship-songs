This is the air I breathe
This is the air I breathe
Your holy presence living in me
[===]
This is my daily bread
This is my daily bread
Your very word spoken to me

And I, I'm desperate for You
And I, I'm lost without You
[===]
This is the air I breathe
This is the air I breathe
Your holy presence living in me
[===]
This is my daily bread
This is my daily bread
Your very word spoken to me
[===]
And I, I'm desperate for You
And I, I'm lost without You
[===]
And I, I'm desperate for You
And I, I'm lost without You
