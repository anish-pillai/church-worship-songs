Draw me close to you
Never let me go
[===]
I'll lay it all down again
To hear you say that I'm your friend
[===]
You are my desire
No one else will do
[===]
Cause nothing else can take your place
To feel the warmth of your embrace
[===]
Help me find the way
Lead me back to you
[===]
You're all I want
You're all I ever needed
[===]
You're all I want
Help me know you are near
