Higher than the mountains that I face
Stronger than the power of the grave
[===]
Constant through the trial and the change
One thing remains, yes, one thing remains
[===]
Your love never fails
It never gives up
It never runs out on me
[===]
Your love never fails
It never gives up
It never runs out on me
[===]
Your love never fails
It never gives up
It never runs out on me
[===]
Because on and on, and on, and on it goes
[===]
Before it overwhelms and satisfies my soul
And I never, ever, have to be afraid
[===]
One thing remains, yes, one thing remains
Sing it, your love
[===]
Your love never fails
It never gives up
It never runs out on me
Your love never fails
It never gives up
It never runs out on me
[===]

Your love never fails
It never gives up
It never runs out on me, oh, Lord
[===]
In death, in life
I'm confident and covered by
The power of your great love
[===]
My debt is paid
There's nothing that can separate
[===]
My heart from your great love
Sing it, your love
[===]
Your love never fails
It never gives up
It never runs out on me
[===]
Your love never fails
It never gives up
It never runs out on me
[===]
Your love never fails
It never gives up
Never runs out on me (never fails)
[===]
Oh, on and on
[===]
Your love goes on and on
Sing it, your love
[===]
Oh, your love goes on and on
His love goes on and on
[===]
Sing it
Because on and on, and on, and on it goes
Before it overwhelms and satisfies my soul
[===]
And I never, ever, have to be afraid
'Cause one thing remains
Yes, one thing remains
[===]
So lift up and shout it
[===]
Your love never fails
Your love never fails
Your love never fails
Your love never fails
[===]
Oh, your love never fails
Your grace never fails me
Yes, you create love
Yes, you create love
[===]
Oh, yes, you create love
Your love, your love, your love...
Yes, you create love
[===]
It never fails
It never fails
[===]
All lift up, and shout his praise
Your love, your love, your love...
[===]
Your love never fails
It never gives up
Never runs out on me
Your love never fails
It never gives up
Never runs out on me
Your love never fails
It never gives up
Never runs out on me, oh
