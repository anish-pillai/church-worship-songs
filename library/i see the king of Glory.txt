I see the King of glory
Coming on the clouds with fire
The whole earth shakes
The whole earth shakes, yeah
[===]
I see His love and mercy
Washing over all our sin
The people sing
The people sing

Hosanna, hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna, hosanna
Hosanna in the highest
[===]
I see a generation
Rising up to take their place
With selfless faith
With selfless faith
