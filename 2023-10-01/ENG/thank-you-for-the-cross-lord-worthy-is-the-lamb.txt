Thank You for the cross, Lord;
Thank You for the price You paid;
Bearing all my sin and shame,
[===]
In love You came,
And gave amazing grace.
[===]
Thank You for this love, Lord;
Thank You for the nail-pierced hands;
Washed me in Your cleansing flow,
[===]
Now all I know
Your forgiveness and embrace.
[===]
Worthy is the Lamb, seated on the throne;
Crown You now with many crowns,
You reign victorious.
[===]
High and lifted up, Jesus Son of God,
The Darling of Heaven crucified;
Worthy is the Lamb, Worthy is the Lamb.
