What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[===]
O precious is the flow
that makes me white as snow;
no other fount I know;
nothing but the blood of Jesus.
[===]
For my pardon this I see:
nothing but the blood of Jesus.
For my cleansing this my plea:
nothing but the blood of Jesus.
