Morning, I see You in the sunrise every morning
It's like a picture that You've painted for me
A love letter in the sky
[===]
Story, I could've had a really different story
But You came down from heaven to restore me
Forever saved my life
[===]
Nobody loves me like You love me, Jesus
I stand in awe of Your amazing ways
I worship You as long as I am breathing
God, You are faithful and true
Nobody loves me like You
[===]
Mountains, You're breaking down the weight of all my mountains
Even when it feels like I'm surrounded
You never leave my side, oh oh oh 
[===]
Nobody loves me like You love me, Jesus
I stand in awe of Your amazing ways
I worship You as long as I am breathing
God, You are faithful and true
Nobody loves me like You
[===]
Oh, what a song to sing
Oh, what a song (my heart keeps singing)
Oh, what a song to sing (what a song)
Oh, what a song to sing (I'll never stop)
Oh, what a song to sing
[===]
Jesus, You love me
And I love You, God
[===]
Nobody loves me like You love me, Jesus
I stand in awe of Your amazing ways
I worship You as long as I am breathing
God, I will worship You, forever worship You
[===]
Nobody loves me like You love me, Jesus
I stand in awe of Your amazing ways
I worship You as long as I am breathing
God, You are faithful and true
Nobody loves me like You
[===]
Nobody loves me like You love me, Jesus (I'm a child of God)
I stand in awe of Your amazing ways (yes, I am)
Nobody loves me like You
Nobody loves me like You
