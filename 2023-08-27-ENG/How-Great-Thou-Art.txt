O Lord, my God, when I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder
Thy power throughout the universe displayed
[===]
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
[===]
And when I think that God, His Son not sparing
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in
That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing
He bled and died to take away my sin
[===]
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
[===]
When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!
Then I shall bow in humble adoration
And then proclaim, "My God, how great Thou art!"
[===]
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art
Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art!
