You paint the night, you count the stars
And you call them by name
The skies proclaim, God you reign

Your glory shines, you teach the sun
When to bring a new day
Creation sings, God, Your reign

God you reign
God you reign
Forever and ever
God you reign

You part the seas, you move the mountains
With the words that you say
My song remains, God you reign

You hold my life, You know my heart
and you call me by name
I live to say, God you reign

God you reign
God you reign
Forever and ever
God you reign (whoa)

God you reign
God you reign
( I know you reign) Forever and ever
God you reign

Hallelujah, Hallelu [x4]

God you reign
God you reign
(you reign over me) Forever and ever
God you reign

God you reign
God you reign
(you reign over me) forever and ever
God you reign (whoa, whoa)
