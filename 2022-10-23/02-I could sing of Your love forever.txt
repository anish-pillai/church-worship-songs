Over the mountains and the sea,
Your river runs with love for me,
and I will open up my heart
and let the Healer set me free.
[===]
I'm happy to be in the truth,
and I will daily lift my hands:
for I will always sing of when
Your love came down.
[===] 
I could sing of Your love forever,
I could sing of Your love forever,
I could sing of Your love forever,
I could sing of Your love forever,
[===]
Oh, I feel like dancing - hey yeaah
it's foolishness I know;
but, when the world has seen the light,
they will dance with joy,
like we're dancing now.
